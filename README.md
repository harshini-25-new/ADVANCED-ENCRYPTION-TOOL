**Tools Used**:

PyCryptodome: Provides AES encryption and decryption functionalities.

Google Colab files module: Enables file uploads and downloads for encryption and decryption.

Python (I/O Operations): Handles file reading, writing, and secure data processing.

**Expected Output**:

Encryption: Users upload a file and provide a password. The encrypted file (.enc) is generated and downloaded automatically.

Decryption: Users upload the .enc file with the same password. The original file (.dec) is restored and downloaded.

This tool ensures data security and integrity with a user-friendly, password-protected encryption system in a cloud environment.
